Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self governed societies based on voluntary institutions
These are often described as stateless societies although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non hierarchical free associations
Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary and harmful
While anti statism is central anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations including but not limited to the state system
Anarchism is usually considered a far left ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti authoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics
Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy
Many types and traditions of anarchism exist not all of which are mutually exclusive
Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism
Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications
Etymology and terminology The word anarchism is composed from the word anarchy and the suffix ism themselves derived respectively from the Greek i e
anarchy from anarchos meaning one without rulers from the privative prefix ἀν an i e
authority sovereignty realm magistracy and the suffix or ismos isma from the verbal infinitive suffix ίζειν izein
Various factions within the French Revolution labelled opponents as anarchists as Robespierre did the Hébertists although few shared many views of later anarchists
There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as William Godwin and Wilhelm Weitling but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs
The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was Pierre Joseph Proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid nineteenth century
Since the s and beginning in France the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the s in the United States its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States
On the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism
History Origins Woodcut from a Diggers document by William Everard The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the th century BC among the works of Taoist philosopher Laozi and in later centuries by Zhuangzi and Bao Jingyan
Zhuangzi s philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist
Diogenes of Sinope and the Cynics as well as their contemporary Zeno of Citium the founder of Stoicism also introduced similar topics
Jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist tradition
Georges Lechartier wrote The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and the first anarchist society was that of the apostles
In early Islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the Islamic civil war over the Caliphate where the Kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the Islamic society
The French renaissance political philosopher Étienne de La Boétie wrote in his most famous work the Discourse on Voluntary Servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent
The radical Protestant Christian Gerrard Winstanley and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the th century in England
The term anarchist first entered the English language in during the English Civil War as a term of abuse used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents
By the time of the French Revolution some such as the Enragés began to use the term positively in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power seeing revolutionary government as oxymoronic
By the turn of the th century the English word anarchism had lost its initial negative connotation
Modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment particularly Jean Jacques Rousseau s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom
As part of the political turmoil of the s in the wake of the French Revolution William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought
Godwin was according to Peter Kropotkin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early Edmund Burke
William Godwin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work
Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism
He argued in Political Justice that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance
He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force
Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power
Rather he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution
His aversion to the imposition of a rules based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people s mental enslavement the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage
He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation
In each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement
The French Pierre Joseph Proudhon is regarded as the first self proclaimed anarchist a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work What is Property
It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory
He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests
His famous quote on the matter is Liberty is the mother not the daughter of order
In this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propriété where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish
He contrasted this with what he called possession or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use
Later however Proudhon added that Property is Liberty and argued that it was a bulwark against state power
His opposition to the state organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time
The anarcho communist Joseph Déjacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian
Unlike Pierre Joseph Proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature
In in Germany the post hegelian philosopher Max Stirner published the book The Ego and Its Own which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism
French anarchists active in the Revolution included Anselme Bellegarrigue Ernest Coeurderoy Joseph Déjacque and Pierre Joseph Proudhon
First International and the Paris Commune Anarchist Mikhail Bakunin opposed the Marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat in favour of universal rebellion and allied himself with the federalists in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists
In Europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of during which ten countries had experienced brief or long term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings
After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists anarchists liberals and nationalists to prevent further revolt
In Spain Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal El Porvenir in La Coruña in which was inspired by Proudhon s ideas
The Catalan politician Francesc Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon s works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party
According to George Woodcock These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after but before that time Proudhonian ideas as interpreted by Pi already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early s
According to the Encyclopædia Britannica During the Spanish revolution of Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralised or cantonalist political system on Proudhonian lines
In the International Workingmen s Association sometimes called the First International united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon Blanquists Philadelphes English trade unionists socialists and social democrats
Due to its links to active workers movements the International became a significant organisation
Karl Marx became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council
Proudhon s followers the mutualists opposed Marx s state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings
Woodcock also reports that the American individualist anarchists Lysander Spooner and William B Greene had been members of the First International
In following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom LPF Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International which had decided not to get involved with the LPF
They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the of property
At first the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction
Subsequently the International became polarised into two camps with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads
Mikhail Bakunin characterised Marx s ideas as centralist and predicted that if a Marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against
Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports that The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune and in the General Council called only a special conference in London
One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy while a technical excuse that they had split away from the Fédération Romande was used to avoid inviting Bakunin s Swiss supporters
Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present and the General Council s resolutions passed almost unanimously
Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers
In the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York
In response the federalist sections formed their own International at the St Imier Congress adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme
The Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from March more formally from March to May
The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco Prussian War
Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune
They included Louise Michel the Reclus brothers and Eugene Varlin the latter murdered in the repression afterwards
As for the reforms initiated by the Commune such as the re opening of workplaces as co operatives anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised
Moreover the Commune s ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas
Indeed the Commune s vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin s and Proudhon s ideas Proudhon like Bakunin had argued in favour of the implementation of the binding mandate in and for federation of communes
Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas
George Woodcock states Organised labour The anti authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho syndicalists seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the State with the free and spontaneous organization of labour
In the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions FOTLU of the United States and Canada unanimously set May as the date by which the eight hour work day would become standard
A sympathetic engraving by Walter Crane of the executed Anarchists of Chicago after the Haymarket affair
The Haymarket affair is generally considered the most significant event for the origin of international May Day observances
In response unions across the United States prepared a general strike in support of the event
On May in Chicago a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd
The next day May anarchists staged a rally at Chicago s Haymarket Square
A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally killing an officer
In the ensuing panic police opened fire on the crowd and each other
Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed
Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer
The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement
Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution
The incident became known as the Haymarket affair and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day
In a second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eight hour day was made
The event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair
Although it had initially been conceived as a once off event by the following year the celebration of International Workers Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker s holiday
In the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from different countries among which important figures of the anarchist movement including Errico Malatesta Pierre Monatte Luigi Fabbri Benoît Broutchoux Emma Goldman Rudolf Rocker and Christiaan Cornelissen
Various themes were treated during the Congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism
A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade unionism
Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient
He thought that the trade union movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and anti worker the phenomenon of professional union officials
Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it
The Spanish Workers Federation in was the first major anarcho syndicalist movement anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain
The most successful was the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo National Confederation of Labour CNT founded in
Before the s the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics attracting million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War
The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association a federation of anarcho syndicalist trade unions founded in with delegates representing two million workers from countries in Europe and Latin America
In Latin America in particular The anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America and until the early s most of the trade unions in Mexico Brazil Peru Chile and Argentina were anarcho syndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the Spanish C N T
as a revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation
The largest and most militant of these organisations was the Federación Obrera Regional Argentina it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million which dwarfed the rival unions
Propaganda of the deed and illegalism Italian American anarchist Luigi Galleani
His followers known as Galleanists carried out a series of bombings and assassination attempts from to in what they saw as attacks on tyrants and enemies of the people Some anarchists such as Johann Most advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter revolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda
Scholars such as Beverly Gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder but targeted killings of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed
However Most himself once boasted that the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents
Therefore massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion
Most is best known for a pamphlet published in The Science of Revolutionary Warfare a how to manual on the subject of making explosives based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in New Jersey
By the s people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings regicides and tyrannicides
From onwards the Russian counterparts of these anti syndicalist anarchist communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations
Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins propaganda by the deed and the anarchist burglars individual reappropriation expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society
Moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt
France s Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism
However as soon as important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts
Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in Le Révolté that a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite
A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement
The anarcho syndicalist Fernand Pelloutier argued in for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter
State repression including the infamous French lois scélérates of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression in the first place may have played a role in these isolated acts
The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and following the suppression of the Paris Commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts
Numerous heads of state were assassinated between and by members of the anarchist movement including Tsar Alexander II of Russia President Sadi Carnot of France Empress Elisabeth of Austria King Umberto I of Italy President William McKinley of the United States King Carlos I of Portugal and King George I of Greece
McKinley s assassin Leon Czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman
Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the s Nestor Makhno with members of the anarchist Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution
However following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left wing opposition the conflict culminated in the Kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed
Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine
There in the Free Territory they fought in the civil war against the Whites a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months
Expelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were among those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising before they left Russia
Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised
For them Bakunin s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new socialist Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true
The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally
Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements
In France and the United States for example members of the major syndicalist movements of the CGT and IWW left the organisations and joined the Communist International
The revolutionary wave of saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism
In the German uprising known as the German Revolution of which established the Bavarian Soviet Republic the anarchists Gustav Landauer Silvio Gesell and Erich Mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures
In the Italian events known as the biennio rosso the anarcho syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana grew to members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union members plus Umanita Nova its daily paper grew accordingly Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces
In the Mexican Revolution the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the early s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja California with the leadership of anarcho communist Ricardo Flores Magón
In Paris the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles which included Nestor Makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism
Their manifesto called the Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists Draft was supported
Platformist groups active today include the Workers Solidarity Movement in Ireland and the North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists of North America
Synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives
In the s this form found as its main proponents Volin and Sebastien Faure
It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations
Conflicts with European fascist regimes In the s and s the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism s conflict with the state
Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti fascist organisation Arditi del Popolo which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August
The veteran Italian anarchist Luigi Fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism describing it as the preventive counter revolution
In France where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the February riots anarchists divided over a united front policy
Anarchists in France and Italy were active in the Resistance during World War II
In Germany the anarchist Erich Mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of February within a few hours after the Reichstag fire in Berlin
Joseph Goebbels the Nazi propaganda minister labelled him as one of those Jewish subversives
Over the next seventeen months he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at Sonnenburg Brandenburg and finally Oranienburg
On February Mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at Oranienburg when finally on the night of July Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning
Spanish Revolution In Spain the national anarcho syndicalist trade union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory
But in the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power
Months later conservative members of the military with the support of minority extreme right parties responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War
In response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land
But even before the fascist victory in the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union
According to Noam Chomsky the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the Spanish anarchists
Not just in Catalonia the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere
The communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the Republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists partially because Stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with Western countries against Hitler
That of course failed and Stalin withdrew the support to the Republic
The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily Catalonia Aragon Andalusia and parts of the Levante
Much of Spain s economy was put under worker control in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia the figure was as high as but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence as the Soviet allied party actively resisted attempts at enactment
Factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes
Anarchist historian Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution which he claimed came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history
Spanish Communist Party led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists
The prominent Italian anarchist Camillo Berneri who volunteered to fight against Franco was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party
The city of Madrid was turned over to the francoist forces by the last non francoist mayor of the city the anarchist Melchor Rodríguez García
Post war years Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of Italy and France
The Mexican Anarchist Federation was established in after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District
In the early s the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociación Libertaria de Cuba Cuban Libertarian Association
From to the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement but was repressed by the new Communist regime
In in France the Fédération Anarchiste and the trade union Confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist Federazione Anarchica Italiana was founded in Italy
Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September and in the Japanese Anarchist Federation was founded
An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May
After World War II an appeal in the Fraye Arbeter Shtime detailing the plight of German anarchists and called for Americans to support them
By February the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large scale operation
The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in and Rudolf Rocker wrote for its organ Die Freie Gesellschaft which survived until
In the Anarcho Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the Argentine Libertarian Federation
The Syndicalist Workers Federation was a syndicalist group in active in post war Britain and one of Solidarity Federation s earliest predecessors
It was formed in by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain
Unlike the AFB which was influenced by anarcho syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist worker centred strategy from the outset
Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time such as Albert Camus Herbert Read Paul Goodman Dwight Macdonald Allen Ginsberg George Woodcock Leopold Kohr Julian Beck John Cage and the French Surrealist group led by André Breton which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Fédération Anarchiste
Anarcho pacifism became influential in the Anti nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Alex Comfort or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho pacifists Ammon Hennacy and Dorothy Day
Anarcho pacifism became a basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War
The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham s Anarchism A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas Volume Two The Emergence of the New Anarchism
Squatting was a prominent part of the emergence of renewed anarchist movement from the counterculture of the s and s
On the roof Occupy and Resist A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the s and s
Anarchism was influential in the Counterculture of the s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts
In in Carrara Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in by the three existing European federations of France the Fédération Anarchiste the Federazione Anarchica Italiana of Italy and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile
In the United Kingdom in the s this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols
The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona Spain
In Denmark squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen
Since the revival of anarchism in the mid th century a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged
Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha feminism they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the s
Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and anarchist historian Andrej Grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism with those who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits of the th century contrasted with the younger activists who are much more informed among other elements by indigenous feminist ecological and cultural critical ideas and who by the turn of the st century formed by far the majority of anarchists
Around the turn of the st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti war anti capitalist and anti globalisation movements
Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization WTO Group of Eight and the World Economic Forum
Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with police
These actions were precipitated by ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet
A significant event of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in
According to anarchist scholar Simon Critchley contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo libertarianism of contemporary neo liberalism One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility whether sexual ecological or socio economic it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality impoverishment and that is so palpable locally and globally
International anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations the International Workers Association and International Libertarian Solidarity
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain in the form of the Confederación General del Trabajo CGT and the CNT
Anarchist schools of thought Portrait of philosopher Pierre Joseph Proudhon by Gustave Courbet
Proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist mutualism and influenced many later individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution
The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty i e
opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one s potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil recognising equality of entitlement
In a chronological and theoretical sense there are classical those created throughout the th century and post classical anarchist schools those created since the mid th century and after
Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it
A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy
One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration first adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol in in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time
collectivist communist mutualist and individualist anarchism it sought to emphasise the anti authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought
Classical anarchist schools of thought Mutualism Mutualism began in th century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States
Proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organisation emerges without central authority a positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order
For this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self governance Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating state protected charters for worker owned cooperatives promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service
Mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform
According to the American mutualist William Batchelder Greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount
Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism
Proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property
Individualist anarchism Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups society traditions and ideological systems
Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict
In William Godwin who has often been cited as the first anarchist wrote Political Justice which some consider the first expression of anarchism
Godwin a philosophical anarchist from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present necessary evil that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge
Godwin advocated individualism proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good
th century philosopher Max Stirner usually considered a prominent early individualist anarchist sketch by Friedrich Engels
An influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and best known proponents of individualist anarchism the German Max Stirner
Stirner s The Ego and Its Own published in is a founding text of the philosophy
According to Stirner the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for God state or morality
To Stirner rights were spooks in the mind and he held that society does not exist but the individuals are its reality
Stirner advocated self assertion and foresaw unions of egoists non systematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state
Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals
It was re discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and homosexual activist John Henry Mackay
Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist and the four page weekly paper he edited during The Peaceful Revolutionist was the first anarchist periodical published
For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster It is apparent that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews William B Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form
Henry David Thoreau was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe
Thoreau was an American author poet naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor historian philosopher and leading
He is best known for his books Walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay Civil Disobedience an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state
Later Benjamin Tucker fused Stirner s egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication Liberty
From these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals free love and birth control advocates see Anarchism and issues related to love and sex individualist naturists nudists see anarcho naturism freethought and anti clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation see European individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in France
These authors and activists included Oscar Wilde Emile Armand Han Ryner Henri Zisly Renzo Novatore Miguel Gimenez Igualada Adolf Brand and Lev Chernyi among others
Social anarchism Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations without any government authority or coercion
Social anarchism rejects private property seeing it as a source of social inequality while retaining respect for personal property and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid
Collectivist anarchism Collectivist anarchism also referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such is a revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin and Johann Most
Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised
This was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production
However was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho communism
This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively upholding the wages system
Collectivist anarchism arose with Marxism but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society
Anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour some held out the possibility of a post revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need
Anarcho communism Anarchist communism also known as anarcho communism libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state markets money private property while retaining respect for personal property and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need
Russian theorist Peter Kropotkin who was influential in the development of anarchist communism Some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism believing anarcho communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom
Most anarcho communists view anarcho communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society
Anarcho communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International
The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro and insurrectionary anti sections
To date the best known examples of an anarchist communist society i e established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution
Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War starting in anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon parts of the Levante and Andalusia as well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war Hitler Mussolini Spanish Communist Party repression backed by the USSR as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself
During the Russian Revolution anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine anarchist communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in
Anarcho syndicalism May day demonstration of Spanish anarcho syndicalist trade union CNT in Bilbao Basque Country in Anarcho syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement
Anarcho syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self managed by workers
The basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are Workers solidarity Direct action and Workers self management Anarcho syndicalists believe that only direct action that is action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing a representative to a government position will allow workers to liberate themselves
Moreover anarcho syndicalists believe that workers organisations the organisations that struggle against the wage system which in anarcho syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society should be self managing
They should not have bosses or business agents rather the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves
Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho syndicalist movement
He outlined a view of the origins of the movement what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his pamphlet Anarcho Syndicalism
The International Workers Association is an international anarcho syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries
The Spanish Confederación Nacional del Trabajo played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement
It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War
Post classical schools of thought Lawrence Jarach left and John Zerzan right two prominent contemporary anarchist authors
Zerzan is known as prominent voice within anarcho primitivism while Jarach is a noted advocate of post left anarchy
Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches
Green anarchism or eco anarchism is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues with an important precedent in anarcho naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho primitivism and social ecology
Writing from a green anarchist perspective John Zerzan attributes the ills of today s social degradation to technology and the birth of agricultural civilization
While Layla AbdelRahim argues that the shift in human consciousness was also a shift in human subsistence strategies whereby some human animals reinvented their narrative to center murder and predation and thereby violence
Thus according to her civilization was the result of the human development of technologies and grammar for predatory economics
Language and literacy she claims are some of these technologies
Anarcha feminism also called anarchist feminism and anarcho feminism combines anarchism with feminism
It generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association
Anarcha feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle and the anarchist struggle against the state
In essence the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa
L Susan Brown claims that as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power it is inherently feminist
Anarcha feminism began with the late th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Emma Goldman and Voltairine de Cleyre
Anarcho pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change see non violence
It developed mostly in the Netherlands Britain and the United States before and during the Second World War
Christian anarchism is a movement in political theology that combines anarchism and Christianity
Its main proponents included Leo Tolstoy Dorothy Day Ammon Hennacy and Jacques Ellul
Platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of Dielo Truda s Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists Draft
The document was based on the experiences of Russian anarchists in the October Revolution which led eventually to the victory of the Bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups
The Platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement s failures during the Russian Revolution
Synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives
In the s this form found as its main proponents the anarcho communists Voline and Sébastien Faure
It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations
Post left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism s relationship to traditional Left wing politics
Some post leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality
Influenced by the work of Max Stirner and by the Marxist Situationist International post left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation
Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises insurrection within anarchist practice
It is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses
Instead insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation
Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack permanent class conflict and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies
Post anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and thought drawing from diverse ideas including post modernism autonomist marxism post left anarchy Situationist International and postcolonialism
Left wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support strongly anti corporatist anti hierarchical pro labour positions and anti capitalism in economics and anti imperialism in foreign policy
Anarcho capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of self ownership in a free market
Anarcho capitalism developed from radical anti state libertarianism and individualist anarchism drawing from Austrian School economics study of law and economics and public choice theory
There is a strong current within anarchism which believes that anarcho capitalism cannot be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as incompatible with capitalist forms
Internal issues and debates consistent with anarchist values is a controversial subject among anarchists
Anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought as such disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common
The compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed
Similarly anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as Marxism communism collectivism syndicalism trade unionism and capitalism
Anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines
within anarcho primitivism and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others
On a tactical level while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the th century e g
the Nihilist movement some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence counter economics and anti state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society
About the scope of an anarchist society some anarchists advocate a global one while others do so by local ones
The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory
Topics of interest Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory
Free love French individualist anarchist Emile Armand who propounded the virtues of free love in the Parisian anarchist milieu of the early th century An important current within anarchism is free love
Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to Josiah Warren and to experimental communities viewed sexual freedom as a clear direct expression of an individual s sovereignty
Free love particularly stressed women s rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women for example marriage laws and anti birth control measures
The most important American free love journal was Lucifer the Lightbearer edited by Moses Harman and Lois Waisbrooker but also there existed Ezra Heywood and Angela Heywood s The Word
Free Society as The Firebrand as Free Society was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the th and beginning of the th centuries
The publication advocated free love and women s rights and critiqued Comstockery censorship of sexual information
Also M E Lazarus was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love
In New York City s Greenwich Village bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self realisation and pleasure for women and also men in the here and now
They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality and the openly bisexual radical Edna St Vincent Millay and the lesbian anarchist Margaret Anderson were prominent among them
Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by Emma Goldman among others
Magnus Hirschfeld noted in that Goldman has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights and especially for those deprived of their rights
Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman indeed the first and only American to take up the defence of homosexual love before the general public
In fact before Goldman heterosexual anarchist Robert Reitzel spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the s in his Detroit based German language journal Der arme Teufel English The Poor Devil
In Argentina anarcha feminist Virginia Bolten published the newspaper called English The Woman s Voice which was published nine times in Rosario between January and January and was revived briefly in
In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Emile Armand
He proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults
In Germany the stirnerists Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality
Mujeres Libres was an anarchist women s organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women
It was founded in by Lucía Sánchez Saornil Mercedes Comaposada and Amparo Poch y Gascón and had approximately members
The organisation was based on the idea of a double struggle for women s liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel
In order to gain mutual support they created networks of women anarchists
Lucía Sánchez Saornil was a main founder of the Spanish anarcha feminist federation Mujeres Libres who was open about her lesbianism
She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalised and subject to censorship and punishment
More recently the British anarcho pacifist Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual The Joy of Sex
The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho hedonist philosopher Michel Onfray in such works as Théorie du corps amoureux pour une érotique solaire and L invention du plaisir fragments cyréaniques
Libertarian education and freethought Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia Catalan anarchist pedagogue and free thinker For English anarchist William Godwin education was the main means by which change would be achieved
Godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness
For Godwin education had to have A respect for the child s autonomy which precluded any form of coercion A pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child s own motivation and initiatives and A concern about the child s capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school
In his Political Justice he criticises state sponsored schooling on account of its obvious alliance with national government
Early American anarchist Josiah Warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established
Max Stirner wrote in a long essay on education called The False Principle of our Education
In it Stirner names his educational principle personalist explaining that self understanding consists in hourly self creation
Education for him is to create free men sovereign characters by which he means eternal characters who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment
In the United States freethought was a basically anti christian anti clerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters
A number of contributors to Liberty anarchist publication were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism
The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co editor of Freethought and for a time The Truth Seeker
Walker was co editor of the excellent free thought free love journal Lucifer the Light Bearer
Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers reprints from freethought papers such as Lucifer the Light Bearer Freethought and The Truth Seeker appeared in Liberty
The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself
In Catalan anarchist and free thinker Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia established modern or progressive schools in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church
The schools stated goal was to educate the working class in a rational secular and non coercive setting
Fiercely anti clerical Ferrer believed in freedom in education education free from the authority of church and state
Murray Bookchin wrote This period s was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence
Perhaps the best known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer s Modern School Escuela Moderna a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally
La Escuela Moderna and Ferrer s ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of Modern Schools in the United States Cuba South America and London
The first of these was started in New York City in
It also inspired the Italian newspaper Università popolare founded in
Russian christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate
Tolstoy s educational experiments were short lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police
He thought that Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself Education is culture under restraint culture is free
Education is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary
A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child led activity replaces pedagogic approaches
Experiments in Germany led to A S Neill founding what became Summerhill School in
Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice
However although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle approach
In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se
The term deschooling was popularised by Ivan Illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead
Criticisms Criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms
Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics

Autism is a disorder characterized by impaired social interaction impaired verbal and non verbal communication and restricted and repetitive behavior
Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child s life
These signs often develop gradually though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress
The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood typically before age three
Autism is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors
Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine
Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes for example the vaccine hypotheses which have been disproven
Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood
In the DSM V autism is included within the autism spectrum ASDs as is Asperger syndrome which lacks delays in cognitive development and language and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified commonly abbreviated as PDD NOS which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met
Early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self care social and communication skills
Although there is no known cure there have been reported cases of children who recovered
Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood though some become successful
An autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder
Globally autism is estimated to affect million people as of
As of the number of people affected is estimated at about per worldwide
It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls
About of children in the United States one in are diagnosed with ASD a increase from one in in
The rate of autism among adults aged years and over in the United Kingdom is
The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the s partly due to changes in diagnostic practice the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved
Characteristics Autism spectrum disorder video Autism is a highly variable disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood and generally follows a steady course without remission
People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal or even superior in others
Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form
It is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and restricted interests and repetitive behavior
Other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis
Autism s individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits
Social development Social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders ASD see Classification from other developmental disorders
People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted
Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with normal neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on Mars
Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name
Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as pointing at things
Three to five year old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others
Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD
Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person s own emotions
Children with high functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non autistic peers despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone
Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism
For them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel
Functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply
There are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD
The limited data suggest that in children with intellectual disability autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and tantrums
Communication About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs
Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver
In the second and third years children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words
Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns
Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD for example they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed at object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience
Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language
In a pair of studies high functioning children with autism aged performed equally well as and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling
Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference
As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends
Repetitive behavior A young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row Autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the Repetitive Behavior Scale Revised RBS R categorizes as follows
Stereotyped behaviors Repetitive movements such as hand flapping head rolling or body rocking
Compulsive behaviors Time consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules such as placing objects in a specific order checking things or hand washing
Sameness Resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted
Ritualistic behavior Unvarying pattern of daily activities such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual
This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors
Restricted interests Interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus such as preoccupation with a single television program toy or game
Self injury Behaviors such as eye poking skin picking hand biting and head banging
No single repetitive or self injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors
Other symptoms Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family
An estimated to of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants
Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population
Sensory abnormalities are found in over of those with autism and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders
Differences are greater for under responsivity for example walking into things than for over responsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements
An estimated of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper
Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three quarters of children with ASD to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator
Selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur this does not appear to result in malnutrition
Although some children with autism also have symptoms there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different symptoms than usual studies report conflicting results and the relationship between problems and ASD is unclear
Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress
Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship
However they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well being and poorer sibling relationships as adults
Causes It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autism s characteristic triad of symptoms
However there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur
Deletion duplication and inversion are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism
Autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants
Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression
Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents
Studies of twins suggest that heritability is for autism and as high as for ASD and siblings of those with autism are about times more likely to be autistic than the general population
However most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified
Typically autism cannot be traced to a Mendelian single gene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD
Numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene
Most loci individually explain less than of cases of autism
The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation such as deletions duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis
Hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome
Several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism
Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion
Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes
All known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development
Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy especially heavy metals and particulates may increase the risk of autism
Environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods infectious diseases solvents diesel exhaust PCBs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines and prenatal stress
No evidence has been found for these claims and some such as the MMR vaccine have been completely disproven
Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination
This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload a vaccine preservative or the MMR vaccine for causing autism
The latter theory was supported by a litigation funded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud
Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children
Mechanism Autism s symptoms result from maturation related changes in various systems of the brain
Its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the linkages between brain structures and behaviors
Pathophysiology Autism affects the amygdala cerebellum and many other parts of the brain
Unlike many other brain disorders such as Parkinson s autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular cellular or systems level it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways or is like intellectual disability a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms
Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product
Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism s mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception
This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors
Just after birth the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood
It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism
It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization
Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following An excess of neurons that causes local in key brain regions
Abnormal formation of synapses and dendritic spines for example by modulation of the neurexin neuroligin cell adhesion system or by poorly regulated synthesis of synaptic proteins
Disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to epilepsy which may explain why the two conditions are associated
The immune system is thought to play an important role in autism
Children with autism have been found by researchers to have inflammation of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro inflammatory cytokines and significant activation of microglia
Biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as deficits in social interactions and communication
Interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life and successful depends on a balanced immune response
It is thought that activation of a pregnant mother s immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development
This is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism
The relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood several have been investigated with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport
The role of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome the most common identified genetic cause of autism has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway
Some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several growth hormones or to impaired regulation of growth factor receptors
Also some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism but probably account for less than of cases
The mirror neuron system MNS theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism s core features of social impairment and communication difficulties
The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action
The MNS may contribute to an individual s understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions intentions and emotions
Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD
However individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object
Autistic individuals tend to use different areas of the brain yellow for a movement task compared to a control group blue
ASD related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks
In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network a large scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing with intact connectivity of the task positive network used in sustained attention and goal directed thinking
In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks possibly reflecting a disturbance of self referential thought
The theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by high level neural connections and synchronization along with an excess of low level processes
Evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that adults with ASD have local in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex
Other evidence suggests the is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex
From studies based on event related potentials transient changes to the brain s electrical activity in response to stimuli there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention orientation to auditory and visual stimuli novelty detection language and face processing and information storage several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli
For example studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain s processing of auditory signals
In the genetic area relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with q deletion syndrome
Research on autism schizophrenia relations for chromosome q chromosome p and chromosome p are inconclusive
Functional connectivity studies have found both hypo and hyper connectivity in brains of people with autism
Hypo connectivity seems to dominate especially for and cortico cortical functional connectivity
Neuropsychology Two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior
Simon Baron Cohen s empathizing systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize that is they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents
An extension the extreme male brain theory hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain defined as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing
These theories are somewhat related to Baron Cohen s earlier theory of mind approach which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others
The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the Sally Anne test for reasoning about others motivations and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in Pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis
However most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ability to understand other people s basic intentions or goals instead data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others viewpoints
The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing the executive functions such as working memory planning inhibition
In his review Kenworthy states that the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial however it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism
Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence but performance never reaches typical adult levels
A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism
Weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism
One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people
A related theory enhanced perceptual functioning focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals
Neither category is satisfactory on its own social cognition theories poorly address autism s rigid and repetitive behaviors while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties
A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful
Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism
Under the DSM autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts as well as restricted repetitive patterns of behavior interests or activities
These deficits are present in early childhood typically before age three and lead to clinically significant functional impairment
Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects
The disturbance must not be better accounted for by Rett syndrome intellectual disability or global developmental delay
Two are commonly used in autism research the Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised ADI R is a semistructured parent interview and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ADOS uses observation and interaction with the child
The Childhood Autism Rating Scale CARS is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children
The Diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders DISCO may also be used
A pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child
If warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions
A pediatric is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions
A differential diagnosis for ASD at this stage might also consider intellectual disability hearing impairment and a specific language impairment such as Landau Kleffner syndrome
The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression
Clinical genetics evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause
Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated of cases to genetic causes consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high resolution chromosome and fragile X testing
A genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genome s copy number variations
As new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge
Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autism s genetics
Metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine
ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example a one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three year old to continue to do so a few years later
In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice
Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits
Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices
The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms
Conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis
It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms
Classification Autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders PDD which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior
These symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance
Of the five PDD forms Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes PDD not otherwise specified PDD NOS also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder
Unlike with autism people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development
The terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism Asperger syndrome and PDD NOS often called the autism spectrum disorders ASD or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism
In this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism ASD and PDD are often used interchangeably
ASD in turn is a subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic like traits such as avoiding eye contact
The manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairments who may be silent developmentally disabled and locked into hand flapping and rocking to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication
Because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary
Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or high functioning autism LFA MFA and HFA based on IQ thresholds or on how much support the individual requires in daily life these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial
Autism can also be divided into syndromal and non syndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis
Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism the extent of the overlap between Asperger syndrome HFA and non syndromal autism is unclear
Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills as opposed to a failure to make progress typically from to months of age
The validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression
Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics
Newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects
It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior
Screening About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child s unusual behaviors by age months and about four fifths notice by age months
According to an article failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations
Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long term outcome
No two word spontaneous not just echolalic phrases by months
Any loss of any language or social skills at any age
The United States Preventive Services Task Force in found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns
The Japanese practice is to screen all children for ASD at and months using autism specific formal screening tests
In contrast in the UK children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened
Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers M CHAT the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire and the First Year Inventory initial data on M CHAT and its predecessor the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers CHAT on children aged months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many false negatives but good specificity few false positives
It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders
Screening tools designed for one culture s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture
Although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical it can be considered in some cases such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features
Prevention Infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than of cases of autism vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases
Management A three year old with autism points to fish in an aquarium as part of an experiment on the effect of intensive shared attention training on language development
The main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence
In general higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes
No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child s needs
Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment
Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy however the development of evidence based interventions has advanced in recent years
Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options
Intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self care social and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated
Available approaches include applied behavior analysis ABA developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy
Among these approaches interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit
There is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention EIBI an early intervention model based on ABA for to hours a week for multiple years is an effective treatment for some children with ASD
Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavioral analysis ABA and developmental social pragmatic models DSP
One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves
Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at home parent implementation
Despite the recent development of parent training models these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment
Education Educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children intensive ABA treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children
Similarly teacher implemented intervention that utilizes an ABA combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be a well established treatment in improving social communication skills in young children although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms
reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided
It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results
The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers
Medication Many medications are used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails
More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics
Antipsychotics such as risperidone and aripiprazole have been found to be useful for treating irritability repetitive behavior and sleeplessness that often occurs with autism however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits and people with autism may respond atypically
There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD
No known medication relieves autism s core symptoms of social and communication impairments
Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism
Alternative medicine Although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies
Treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real world relevance
Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing training availability and parent requests
A study found that compared to their peers autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein free diets in botched chelation therapy killed a five year old child with autism
There has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism
Although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism there is no good evidence that a gluten free diet is of benefit
In the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors
For someone born in a US study estimated an average lifetime cost of net present value in dollars inflation adjusted from estimate with about medical care extra education and other care and lost economic productivity
Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child and unreimbursed out of pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems one US study found a average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment
US states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance
After childhood key treatment issues include residential care job training and placement sexuality social skills and estate planning
Society and culture The emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism
Through this movement people hope to cause others to think of autism as a difference instead of a disease
Proponents of this movement wish to seek acceptance not cures
There have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as World Autism Awareness Day Light It Up Blue Autism Sunday Autistic Pride Day Autreat and others
There have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someone s life
These organizations include Autism Speaks Autism National Committee Autism Society of America and many others
Social science scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about autism as a culture transcultural comparisons and research on social movements
Media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism
Rain Man a film that won Oscars including Best Picture depicts a character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities
While many autistics don t have these special abilities there are some autistic individuals who have been successful in their fields
Children recover occasionally so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not
It is not known how often recovery happens reported rates in unselected samples of children with ASD have ranged from to
Most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger though a few have developed communication skills in later years
Most children with autism lack social support meaningful relationships future employment opportunities or self determination
Although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age
Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but a few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife
Acquiring language before age six having an IQ above and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism
Most people with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood
Epidemiology Reports of autism cases per children grew dramatically in the US from to
It is unknown how much if any growth came from changes in rates of autism
Most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of per for autism and close to per for ASD and per children in the United States for ASD as of because of inadequate data these numbers may underestimate ASD s true rate
Globally autism affects an estimated million people as of while Asperger syndrome affects a further million
In the NHS estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged years and over in the UK was
Rates of PDD NOS s has been estimated at per Asperger syndrome at roughly per and childhood disintegrative disorder at per
CDC s most recent estimate is that out of every children or per has an ASD as of
The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the s and early s
This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out
The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism s true prevalence has increased a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics
The sex ratio averages and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to with intellectual disability and more than without
Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed one theory is that females are underdiagnosed
Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy related risk factor as a cause of autism the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent and with diabetes bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy
The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism
Most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism
About of autism cases have an identifiable Mendelian single gene condition chromosome abnormality or other genetic syndrome and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders
The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from to a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence
In comparison for PDD NOS the association with intellectual disability is much weaker and by definition the diagnosis of Asperger s excludes intellectual disability
Anxiety disorders are common among children with ASD there are no firm data but studies have reported prevalences ranging from to
Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself or are hard to distinguish from ASD s symptoms
Epilepsy with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age cognitive level and type of language disorder
Several metabolic defects such as phenylketonuria are associated with autistic symptoms
Minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population
Although the DSM IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism the full criteria for Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD Tourette syndrome and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted
Sleep problems affect about two thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood
These most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep frequent nocturnal awakenings and early morning awakenings
Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis
History Leo Kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in
A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named
The Table Talk of Martin Luther compiled by his notetaker Mathesius contains the story of a year old boy who may have been severely autistic
Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil and suggested that he be suffocated although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report
The earliest well documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue as detailed in a court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair s marriage to gain Blair s inheritance
The Wild Boy of Aveyron a feral child caught in showed several signs of autism the medical student Jean Itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation
The New Latin word autismus English translation autism was coined by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia
He derived it from the Greek word autós αὐτός meaning self and used it to mean morbid self admiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance
The word autism first took its modern sense in when Hans Asperger of the Vienna University Hospital adopted Bleuler s terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in German about child psychology
Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as Asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until
Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital first used autism in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a report of children with striking behavioral similarities
Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner s first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders
It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger
He was diagnosed by Leo Kanner after being first examined in and was labeled as case
Triplett was noted for his savant abilities particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers
His father Oliver described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns music notes letters of the alphabet and U S president pictures
By the age of he had the ability to recite the rd Psalm and memorized questions and answers from the Presbyterian catechism
Kanner s reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatry s focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant s response to refrigerator mothers
Starting in the late s autism was established as a separate syndrome
As late as the mid s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism while in it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions
Although the rise of parent organizations and the of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child s autistic behavior is perceived negatively and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research
It took until for the DSM III to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia
In the DSM III R provided a checklist for diagnosing autism
In May the DSM was released updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders
The grouping of disorders including PDD NOS Autism Asperger Syndrome Rett Syndrome and CDD has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders
The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and or interaction and restricted and or repetitive behaviors
The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely
Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being
Percentage of diffusely reflected sunlight in relation to various surface conditions Albedo is a measure for reflectance or optical brightness Latin albedo whiteness of a surface
It is dimensionless and measured on a scale from zero corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation to one corresponding to a white body that reflects all incident radiation
Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of irradiance reflected to the irradiance received by a surface
The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth s surface
These factors vary with atmospheric composition geographic location and time see Position of the Sun
While bi hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence i e for a given position of the sun albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period
The temporal resolution may range from seconds as obtained from flux measurements to daily monthly or annual averages
Unless given for a specific wavelength spectral albedo albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation
Due to measurement constraints it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface approximately between and μm
This spectrum includes visible light μm which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark e g trees absorb most radiation whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright e g snow reflects most radiation
Albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and environmental management e g as part of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED program for sustainable rating of buildings
The average albedo of the Earth at the top of the atmosphere its planetary albedo is to because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features
The term albedo was introduced into optics by Johann Heinrich Lambert in his work Photometria
Terrestrial albedo Sample albedos Surface Typicalalbedo Fresh asphalt Open ocean Worn asphalt Conifer forest Summer to Deciduous trees to Bare soil Green grass Desert sand New concrete Ocean ice Fresh snow Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about for fresh snow to about for charcoal one of the darkest substances
Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body
When seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms
Most land areas are in an albedo range of to
This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds
mean annual clear sky and total sky albedo Earth s surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA s MODIS instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites and the CERES instrument on the Suomi NPP and JPSS
As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite not all directions a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance e g
These calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function BRDF which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle
Thereby the BRDF allows to translate observations of reflectance into albedo
Earth s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about C
If Earth were frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below C
If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about C
In contrast if the entire Earth was covered by water a so called aquaplanet the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost C
White sky and black sky albedo For land surfaces it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle θ i can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms the directional hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle and the bi hemispherical reflectance with being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle and being the proportion of diffuse illumination
Hence the actual albedo also called blue sky albedo can then be given as Directional hemispherical reflectance is sometimes referred to as black sky albedo and bi hemispherical reflectance as white sky albedo
These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface
Astronomical albedo The albedos of planets satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties
The study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry
For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos
For example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids
Enceladus a moon of Saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System with of EM radiation reflected
Another notable high albedo body is Eris with an albedo of
Many small objects in the outer Solar System and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about
Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds
The overall albedo of the Moon is measured to be around but it is strongly directional and non Lambertian displaying also a strong opposition effect
Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless Solar System bodies
Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the V band geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the Bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected
Their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion
In detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five Hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces
The correlation between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is where is the astronomical albedo is the diameter in kilometers and is the absolute magnitude
Examples of terrestrial albedo effects Illumination Although the albedo temperature effect is best known in colder whiter regions on Earth the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year round illumination is greater
The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere varying between three and twelve degrees north
The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination
Insolation effects The intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation solar irradiance high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation where areas such as the Sahara Desert which also have a relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation
Tropical and sub tropical rainforest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation
Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes
Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb effectively cooling the Earth
This has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker being water or ground which is darker color and reflects less heat back into space
Climate and weather Albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs
The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land ice or ocean surfaces can drive weather
Albedo temperature feedback When an area s albedo changes due to snowfall a snow temperature feedback results
A layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling
In principle if no outside temperature change affects this area e g a warm air mass the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snow temperature feedback
However because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight higher insolation cause melting
When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass or soil the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating
Snow Snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as for freshly fallen snow to about for melting snow and as low as for dirty snow
If a marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack the ice albedo positive feedback
Cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets
Hence small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions
Small scale effects Albedo works on a smaller scale too
In sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing
Solar photovoltaic effects Albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices
For example the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon a Si H and crystalline silicon c Si based compared to traditional spectral integrated albedo predictions
More recently the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of commonly occurring surface materials both human made and natural and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies industrial solar farms commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched roof applications
Trees Because forests generally have a low albedo the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation
In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect
The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts a strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds Scientists generally treat as a net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate In seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are to higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily
Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about to whereas coniferous trees have a value of about to
Studies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests
They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes e g Siberia were neutral or perhaps warming
Water Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials
The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations see graph
Reflectivity of smooth water at C refractive index At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner not diffusely
The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this
At small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity vs incident angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle
Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles
Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light
Note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities
Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near to a maximum approaching
On any given day about half of Earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water
Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth
Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic
A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies
Aerosol effects Aerosols very fine particles droplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on Earth s radiative balance
The direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain
The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming
Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei
Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased light scattering and radiative cooling first indirect effect but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud second indirect effect
Black carbon Another albedo related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles
The size of this effect is difficult to quantify the Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is W m with a range to W m
Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo
Human activities Human activities e g deforestation farming and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe
However quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult
Other types of albedo Single scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles
It depends on properties of the material refractive index the size of the particle or particles and the wavelength of the incoming radiation

Writing cursive forms of A A named plural As A s a s a s or aes is the first letter and the first vowel of the ISO basic Latin alphabet
It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter alpha from which it derives
The upper case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar
The lower case version can be written in two forms the double storey a and single storey ɑ
The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it especially fonts intended to be read by children and is also found in italic type

In turn the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs styled as a triangular head with two horns extended
In B C E the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms
Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the Hebrew or Arabic aleph
Blackletter ABlackletter A Uncial AUncial A Another Capital AAnother Blackletter A Modern Roman AModern Roman A Modern Italic AModern Italic A Modern Script AModern script A When the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop the consonant sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel and called it by the similar name of alpha
In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages dating to the th century BC the letter rests upon its side but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set
The Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the Italian Peninsula and left the letter unchanged
The Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write the Latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the Latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages including English
During Roman times there were many variant forms of the letter A
First was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent mediums
There was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces
Due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule
Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles
The known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial
Typographic variants include a double storey a and single storey ɑ At the end of the Roman Empire th century AD several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe
Among these were the semicursive minuscule of Italy the Merovingian script in France the Visigothic script in Spain and the Insular or Anglo Irish semi uncial or Anglo Saxon majuscule of Great Britain
By the th century the Caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press
This form was derived through a combining of prior forms
th century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today
These variants the Italic and Roman forms were derived from the Caroline Script version
The Italic form also called script a is used in most current handwriting and consists of a circle and vertical stroke
This slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the Greek letter tau in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers
The Roman form is used in most printed material it consists of a small loop with an arc over it a
In Greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown
In some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form
Italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest set in Roman type
There are some other cases aside from italic type where script a ɑ also called Latin alpha is used in contrast with Latin a such as in the International Phonetic Alphabet
Use in writing systems x px English In modern English orthography the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds the near open front unrounded vowel as in pad the open back unrounded vowel as in father which is closer to its original Latin and Greek sound the diphthong as in ace and major usually when is followed by one or occasionally two consonants and then another vowel letter this results from Middle English lengthening followed by the Great Vowel Shift the modified form of the above sound that occurs before as in square and Mary the rounded vowel of water the shorter rounded vowel not present in General American in was and what a schwa in many unstressed syllables as in about comma solar
The double sequence does not occur in native English words but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as Aaron and aardvark
However occurs in many common digraphs all with their own sound or sounds particularly and
is the third most commonly used letter in English after and and the second most common in Spanish and French
In one study on average about of letters used in English texts tend to be while the number is in Spanish and in French
Other languages In most languages that use the Latin alphabet denotes an open unrounded vowel such as or
An exception is Saanich in which and the glyph Á stands for a close mid front unrounded vowel
Other systems In phonetic and phonemic notation in the International Phonetic Alphabet is used for the open front unrounded vowel is used for the open central unrounded vowel and is used for the open back unrounded vowel
in X SAMPA is used for the open front unrounded vowel and is used for the open back unrounded vowel
Other uses In algebra the letter a along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet x y z are used to denote unknown quantities
A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A
A is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status A A or A the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students schoolwork A grade for clean restaurants A list celebrities etc
Such associations can have a motivating effect as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance when compared with other letters
Finally the letter A is used to denote size as in a narrow size shoe or a small cup size in a brassiere

Charcoal from indigenous camp fires in the cave has been dated as early as to BC
The European American naming of the Alabama River and state was derived from the Alabama people a Muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river
In the Alabama language the word for a person of Alabama lineage is Albaamo or variously Albaama or Albàamo in different dialects the plural form is Albaamaha
The word Alabama is believed to have come from the Alabama language a suggestion that the name was borrowed from the Choctaw language is unlikely
The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of Garcilaso de la Vega used Alibamo while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu respectively in of the term
As early as the French called the tribe the Alibamon with French maps identifying the river as Rivière des Alibamons
Other spellings of the name have included Alibamu Alabamo Albama Alebamon Alibama Alibamou Alabamu Allibamou
Some scholars suggest the word comes from the Choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather
The meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants
The state has numerous place names of Native American origin
However there are no correspondingly similar words in the Alabama language

History Pre European settlement The Moundville Archaeological Site in Hale County
It was occupied by Native Americans of the Mississippian culture from to AD
Indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization
Trade with the northeastern tribes by the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period BC AD and continued until European contact
The agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from to AD with one of its major centers built at what is now the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville Alabama
This is the second largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era after Cahokia in present day Illinois which was the center of the culture
Analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex SECC
Contrary to popular belief the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture but developed independently
The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood
Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in present day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Cherokee an Iroquoian language people and the Muskogean speaking Alabama Alibamu Chickasaw Choctaw Creek and Koasati

They wrote another constitution in and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools
The same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools
After disfranchising most African Americans and many poor whites in the constitution the Alabama legislature passed more Jim Crow laws at the beginning of the th century to impose segregation in everyday life
th century The developing skyline of Birmingham in The new Constitution of Alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans and tens of thousands of poor whites through making voter registration difficult requiring a poll tax and literacy test
By only African Americans were registered in Alabama although at least were literate
This compared to more than African Americans eligible to vote in
The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the s jails were segregated in hospitals in toilets hotels and restaurants in and bus stop waiting rooms in
While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting the new restrictions resulted in their as well due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax
By whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws whites vs African Americans
Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote
Despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain
The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens
The rural dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes
Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South the Rosenwald Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools
In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs
The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest
Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas
The former Mount Sinai School in rural Autauga County completed in
It was one of the Rosenwald Schools built in the state
Beginning in the first Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama for African American children
A total of schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by in the state
Several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places
Continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South
Reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in Alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from to
At the same time many rural people both white and African American migrated to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs
Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the Magic City
By the s Birmingham was the th largest city in the United States and had more than of the state s population
Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy
Its residents were under represented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution
This did not change until the late s following a lawsuit and court order
Beginning in the s when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters the Alabama legislature took several counter steps designed to disfranchise black voters
The legislature passed and the voters ratified as these were mostly white voters a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants
Black citizens in Mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment
The legislature also changed the boundaries of Tuskegee to a sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits
The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial gerrymandering violated the Constitution
In the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections
Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war
Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living
One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile
Between and more than people moved into the city to work for war related industries
Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base
Despite massive population changes in the state from to the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses
They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas
In addition the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham
One result was that Jefferson County containing Birmingham s industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services
A study noted that because of rural domination a minority of about per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature
A class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in Lowndes County Alabama challenged the state legislature s lack of redistricting for congressional seats
In White v Crook Judge Frank M Johnson ordered the state to redistrict
United States Supreme Court cases of Baker v Carr and Reynolds v Sims ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties as Alabama had used for its senate
In for the first time since the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census
